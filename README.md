## 1. Research Publications

You can find a list of our research publications in the [OptMeowt Analysis extension repo](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-optmeowt?tab=readme-ov-file#1-research-publications).

## 2. Introduction

The GPC Web Crawler analyzes websites' compliance with [Global Privacy Control (GPC)](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) at scale. GPC is a privacy preference signal that people can use to exercise their rights to opt out from web tracking. The GPC Web Crawler is based on [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and the [OptMeowt Analysis extension](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/tree/main/gpc-analysis-extension).

## 3. Data

To track the evolution of GPC compliance on the web over time we are performing regular crawls of a set of 11,708 websites. Our crawl results are publicly available (results are for California; Connecticut and Colorado coming soon):

<p>

Please note the following:

- While our Crawler has high accuracy, occasional misclassifications are possible (for the accuracy of our Crawler see section 3.5 of our paper ["Websites' Global Privacy Control Compliance at Scale and over Time"](https://sebastianzimmeck.de/hausladenEtAlGPCWeb2025.pdf)). For the most recent accuracy measures, please refer to this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZNE0hywsv-rVlcgsFpEgwta5d2Mmx5ik4DWxAvTaNFM/edit?gid=2089868373#gid=2089868373).
- Whether GPC applies to a site depends on thresholds of revenue, users, and other criteria. In our paper we estimated GPC applicability based on a site's web traffic estimate (see section 3.2 of our [paper](https://sebastianzimmeck.de/hausladenEtAlGPCWeb2025.pdf)).

If you have any questions or suggestions, especially, if you believe a website has been incorrectly identified as non-compliant, please contact us at sebastian[at]privacytechlab.org.

## 4. Development

You can install the GPC Web Crawler on a consumer-grade computer. We use a MacBook. Get started as follows:

0. If you want to test sites' compliance with a particular law, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), make sure to crawl the sites from a computer in the respective geographical location. If you are located in a different location, you can use a VPN. For example, we perform our crawls for the CCPA using [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/en) set to Los Angeles, California.

1. Sign in to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/), or create a Docker account if you do not already have one.

2. Download Docker by following the instructions in the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).

3. Authenticate to Docker Hub by following the instructions in the [official Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/#authenticate-to-docker-hub-with-web-based-login).

4. Clone this repo locally or download a zipped copy and unzip it.

5. If you are performing a test run of the Crawler or plan on running the Crawler on your own set of sites, follow the directions in the sublist of this bullet. If not, skip to step 6.

   1. Open sites.csv and enter the URLs of the sites you want to analyze in the first column. Some examples are included in the file - do not change anything if you simply want to perform a test run.

   2. In the root directory of the repo, the Crawler can be started on the chosen test batch of sites in sites.csv with debug mode on by running:

      ```console
      make custom
      ```

6. To run the Crawler on one of our eight preselected batches:

   1. If you have already run the Crawler (perhaps to test it, or on another batch) and have containers running, run:

      ```console
      make stop && make clean
      ```

   2. To start the Crawler with debug mode off, run:

      ```console
      make start
      ```

      or to start the Crawler with debug mode on:

      ```console
      make start-debug
      ```

   3. When prompted with "Enter a batch number (1-8):", enter a number from one to eight, representing which batch of sites you wish to crawl.

   4. If the crawl unexpectedly fails midway through, run

      ```console
      make start
      ```

      again and re-select the batch that failed to analyze.

7. To check the analysis results, open a browser and navigate to <http://localhost:8080/analysis>. Ports may be different depending on your local server setup. So, you would need to adjust the URL or your configuration accordingly.

   - After the crawl is completed, a .json file containing the analysis results will also be dumped in the `crawl_results` directory.

8. To view the crawl results in a phpmyadmin interface, navigate to `localhost` in your browser. Enter the following credentials when prompted.

   - Username: root
   - Password: toor

9. If you modify the analysis extension, you should test it to make sure it still works properly. Some guidelines can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/wiki/Testing-the-OptMeowt-Analysis-Extension).

**Note**: When you perform a crawl, for one reason or another, some sites may fail to analyze. We always perform a second crawl for the sites that failed the first time (i.e., the redo sites).

## 5. Architecture

Here is an overview of the GPC Web Crawler architecture:

![crawler-architecture](crawler-architecture.png)

One caveat is that all of this happens in a Docker compose stack. Each aspect of this diagram (Selenium remote-controlled browser, REST API, and SQL database) live in their own container and their lifecycle is managed simultaneously. The editable version of this image is in the [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lngYynWwW2UdKyUY5vKhfJ413DSvlGgU/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112157414060543752223&rtpof=true&sd=true).

For a more in-depth look at how the GPC Web Crawler works, check out our [Beginners Guide to GPC Web Crawler](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11RvO7fwe3hhugcK9u3rzGDcIfAKkc7kPUcigTv411_8/edit?usp=sharing). (The document is up to date as of its date. Later changes to the Crawler are not reflected.)

## 6. Components

The GPC Web Crawler consists of various components:

### 6.1 Crawler Script

The flow of the Crawler script is described in the diagram below.

![analysis-flow](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/assets/40359590/6261650d-1cc3-4a8e-b6e2-da682e4c1251)

This script is stored and executed on a Desktop environment living in a Docker image. The Crawler also keeps a log of sites that cause errors. It stores these logs in the `error-logging.json` file and updates this file after each error.

#### Types of Errors that May Be Logged

1. `TimeoutError`: A Selenium error that is thrown when either the page has not loaded in 30 seconds or the page has not responded for 30 seconds. Timeouts are set in `driver.setTimeouts`.
2. `HumanCheckError`: A custom error that is thrown when the site has a title that we have observed means our VPN IP address is blocked or there is a human check on that site. See [Limitations/Known Issues](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler#5-limitationsknown-issues) for more details.
3. `InsecureCertificateError`: A Selenium error that indicates that the site will not be loaded, as it has an insecure certificate.
4. `WebDriverError`: A Selenium error that indicates that the WebDriver has failed to execute some part of the script.
5. `WebDriverError: Reached Error Page`: This error indicates that an error page has been reached when Selenium tried to load the site.
6. `UnexpectedAlertOpenError`: This error indicates that a popup on the site disrupted Selenium's ability to analyze the site (such as a mandatory login).

### 6.2 OptMeowt Analysis Extension

The [OptMeowt Analysis extension](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-optmeowt) is [packaged as an xpi file](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/wiki/Pack-Extension-in-XPI-Format) and installed on a Firefox Nightly browser by the Crawler script. When a site loads, the OptMeowt Analysis extension automatically analyzes the site and sends the analysis data to the local SQL database via a POST request. The analysis performed by the OptMeowt Analysis extension investigates the GPC compliance of a given site using a 4-step approach:

1. The extension checks whether the site is subject to the CCPA by looking at [Firefox's urlClassification object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/onHeadersReceived#urlclassification). Requests returned by this object are based on the Disconnect list per [Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop). Sending data to a site on the Disconnect will often qualify as sharing or selling of data subject to people's opt out right.
2. The extension checks the value of the [US Privacy string](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/USPrivacy/tree/master), the [GPP string](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/Global-Privacy-Platform/blob/main/Core/Consent%20String%20Specification.md), and OneTrust's OptanonConsent, OneTrustWPCCPAGoogleOptOut, and OTGPPConsent cookies, if any of these exist.
3. The extension sends a GPC signal to the site.
4. The extension rechecks the value of the US Privacy string, OneTrust cookies, and GPP string. If a site respects GPC, the values should be now set to opt out.

The information collected during this process is used to determine whether the site respects GPC. Note that legal obligations to respect GPC differ by geographic location. In order for a site to be GPC compliant, the following statements should be true after the GPC signal was sent for each string or cookie that the site implemented:

1. The third character of the US Privacy string is a `Y`.
2. The value of the OptanonConsent cookie is `isGpcEnabled=1`.
3. The opt out columns in the GPP string's relevant [US section](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/Global-Privacy-Platform/tree/main/Sections) (i.e., `SaleOptOut`, `TargetedAdvertisingOptOut`, `SharingOptOut`) have a value of `1`; Note that the columns and opt out requirements vary by state.
4. The value of the OneTrustWPCCPAGoogleOptOut cookie is `true`.

### 6.3 Node.js REST API

We use the REST API to make GET, PUT, and POST requests to the SQL database. The REST API is also local and is run in a separate terminal from the Crawler. Instructions for the REST API can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/wiki/How-to-run-REST-API).

### 6.4 SQL Database

The SQL database is a local database that stores analysis data. Instructions to set up the SQL database can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/wiki/Setting-Up-Local-SQL-Database). The columns of our database tables are below:

| id  | site_id | domain | sent_gpc | uspapi_before_gpc | uspapi_after_gpc | usp_cookies_before_gpc | usp_cookies_after_gpc | OptanonConsent_before_gpc | OptanonConsent_after_gpc | gpp_before_gpc | gpp_after_gpc | gpp_version | urlClassification | OneTrustWPCCPAGoogleOptOut_before_gpc | OneTrustWPCCPAGoogleOptOut_after_gpc | OTGPPConsent_before_gpc | OTGPPConsent_after_gpc |
| --- | ------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |

The first few columns primarily pertain to identifying the site and verifying that the OptMeowt Analysis extension is working properly.

- `id`: autoincrement primary key to identify the database entry (not zero indexed)
- `site_id`: the id of the domain in the csv file that lists the sites to crawl (zero indexed). This id is used for processing purposes (i.e., to identify domains that redirect to another domain) and is set by the Crawler script
- `domain`: the domain name of the site
- `sent_gpc`: a binary indicator of whether the OptMeowt Analysis extension sent a GPC opt out signal to the site

The remaining columns pertain to the opt out status of a user, i.e., the OptMeowt Analysis extension, which is indicated by the value of the US Privacy string, OptanonConsent cookie, and GPP string. The US Privacy string can be implemented on a site via (1) the [client-side JavaScript USPAPI](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/USPrivacy/blob/master/CCPA/USP%20API.md), which returns the US Privacy string value when called, or (2) an [HTTP cookie that stores its value](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/USPrivacy/blob/master/CCPA/US%20Privacy%20String.md). The OptMeowt Analysis extension checks each site for both implementations of the US Privacy string by calling the USPAPI and checking all cookies. The GPP string's value is obtained via the [CMPAPI for GPP](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/Global-Privacy-Platform/blob/main/Core/CMP%20API%20Specification.md).

- `uspapi_before_gpc`: return value of calling the USPAPI before a GPC opt out signal is sent
- `uspapi_after_gpc`: return value of calling the USPAPI after a GPC opt out signal was sent
- `usp_cookies_before_gpc`: the value of the US Privacy string in an HTTP cookie before a GPC opt out signal is sent
- `usp_cookies_after_gpc`: the value of the US Privacy string in an HTTP cookie after a GPC opt out signal was sent
- `OptanonConsent_before_gpc`: the `isGpcEnabled` string from OneTrust's OptanonConsent cookie before a GPC opt out signal is sent. The user is opted out if `isGpcEnabled=1`, and the user is not opted out if `isGpcEnabled=0`. If the cookie is present but does not have an `isGpcEnabled` string, we return "no_gpc"
- `OptanonConsent_after_gpc`: the `isGpcEnabled` string from OneTrust's OptanonConsent cookie after a GPC opt out signal was sent. The user is opted out if `isGpcEnabled=1`, and the user is not opted out if `isGpcEnabled=0`. If the cookie is present but does not have an `isGpcEnabled` string, we return "no_gpc"
- `gpp_before_gpc`: the value of the GPP string before a GPC opt out signal is sent
- `gpp_after_gpc`: the value of the GPP string after a GPC opt out signal was sent
- `gpp_version`: the version of the CMP API that obtains the GPP string (i.e., v1.0 has a `getGPPdata` command while v1.1 removes the `getGPPdata` command and its return values in favor of callback functions)
- `urlClassification`: the return value of [Firefox's urlClassificaton object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/onHeadersReceived#urlclassification), sorted by category and filtered for the following categories: `fingerprinting`, `tracking_ad`, `tracking_social`, `any_basic_tracking`, `any_social_tracking`
- `OneTrustWPCCPAGoogleOptOut_before_gpc`: the value of the OneTrustWPCCPAGoogleOptOut cookie before a GPC signal is sent. This cookie is [described by OneTrust](https://my.onetrust.com/articles/en_US/Knowledge/UUID-2dc719a8-4be5-8d16-1dc8-c7b4147b88e0). Additional information is available in [issue #94](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/issues/94)
- `OneTrustWPCCPAGoogleOptOut_after_gpc`: the value of the OneTrustWPCCPAGoogleOptOut cookie after a GPC signal was sent. This cookie is [described by OneTrust](https://my.onetrust.com/articles/en_US/Knowledge/UUID-2dc719a8-4be5-8d16-1dc8-c7b4147b88e0). Additional information is available in [issue #94](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/issues/94)
- `OTGPPConsent_before_gpc`: the value of the OTGPPConsent cookie before a GPC signal is sent. This cookie is [described by OneTrust](https://my.onetrust.com/articles/en_US/Knowledge/UUID-2dc719a8-4be5-8d16-1dc8-c7b4147b88e0). Additional information is available in [issue #94](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/issues/94)
- `OTGPPConsent_after_gpc`: the value of the OTGPPConsent cookie after a GPC signal was sent. This cookie is [described by OneTrust](https://my.onetrust.com/articles/en_US/Knowledge/UUID-2dc719a8-4be5-8d16-1dc8-c7b4147b88e0). Additional information is available in [issue #94](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/issues/94)

### 6.5 Well-Known Crawls

Running the Dockerized version of the crawler will also run a well-known crawl. For details on the well-known, see the [GPC spec's GPC Support Resource section](https://w3c.github.io/gpc/#gpc-support-resource)
. The results of the well-known crawl will be stored in the 'crawl_results' subfolder.

When running a crawl batch, the following files and folders are created: analysis.json, debug.json, an error-logging folder, well-known-data.csv, and well-known-errors.json. If the last two files are present, then the well-known crawl ran successfully!

You can also run the well-know crawl separately. For more information [see section 8.2](#82-well-knowngpcjson-python-script).

## 7. Limitations/Known Issues/Bug Fixes

### 7.1 Sites that Cannot Be Analyzed

Since we are using Selenium and a VPN to visit the sites we analyze, there are some limitations to the sites we can analyze.
There are some types of sites that we cannot analyze due to our methodology:

1. Sites where the VPN's IP address is blocked.

   For example, a site titled "Access Denied" that says we do not have permission to access the site on this server is loaded instead of the real site.

2. Sites that have some kind of human check.

   Some sites can detect that we are using automation tools (i.e., Selenium) and do not let us access the real site. Instead, we are redirected to a page with some kind of captcha or puzzle. We do not try to bypass any human checks.

   Since the data collected from both of these types of sites (i.e., (1) sites that block our VPN's IP address and (2) sites that have some kind of human check) will be incorrect and occur because our automation was detected, we list them under `HumanCheckError` in the `error-logging.json` file. We have observed a few different site titles that indicate we have reached a site in one of these categories. Most of the titles occur for multiple sites, with the most common being "Just a Moment…" on a captcha from Cloudflare. We detect when our Crawler visits one of these sites by matching the site title of the loaded site with a set of regular expressions that match with the known titles. Clearly, we will miss some sites in this category if we have not seen it and added the title to the set of regular expressions. We are updating the regular expressions as we see more sites like this. For more information, see [issue #51](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/issues/51).

3. Sites that block script injection.

   For instance, <https://www.flickr.com> blocks script injection and will not successfully be analyzed. In the debugging table, on the first attempt, the last message will be `runAnalysis-fetching`, and on the second attempt, the extension logs `SQL POSTING: SOMETHING WENT WRONG`.

4. Sites that redirect between multiple domains throughout analysis.

   For instance, <https://spothero.com/> and <https://parkingpanda.com/> are now one entity but still can use both domains. In the debugging table, you will see multiple debugging entries under each domain. Because we store analysis data by domain, the data will be incomplete and will not be added to the database.

### 7.2 Important Bug Fixes

1. At some point the Crawler kept returning an empty result for [Firefox's urlClassification object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/onHeadersReceived#urlclassification). @eakubilo [fixed this tricky bug](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/issues/122#issuecomment-2332655459).

## 8. Other Resources

### 8.1 Python Library for GPP String Decoding

GPP strings must be decoded. The IAB provides a [JavaScript library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iabgpp/cmpapi) and an [interactive html decoder](https://iabgpp.com/#) to do so. To integrate decoding with our colab notebooks for data analysis, we rewrote the library in Python. The library is hosted in the [`cmp_api_python` directory](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/tree/main/cmp_api_python) of this repository. More info can be found in our [Wiki](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/wiki/Instructions-for-Lab-Members-Performing-Crawls#gpp-string-decoding) and the [related issue](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-web-crawler/issues/89).

### 8.2 .well-known/gpc.json Python Script

Part of each crawl is also a well-known crawl. However, if you want, you can also run a separate well-known crawl with our Python script, `selenium-optmeowt-crawler/well-known-collection.py`.

Here are the steps for doing so:

1. Just as the GPC Web Crawler, this script should be run using the same VPN location after all eight crawl batches are completed.
2. Ensure the lock screen setting is as for the usual crawl.
3. Change directories to `well-known-crawl`.
4. On line 25 of `well-known-adhoc.py`, change `csv_path` to the location of the list of sites you wish to crawl.
5. On line 38 of `well-known-adhoc.py`, change `save_path` to the location you wish to save the results to, for example: `save_path = "well-known-data.csv"'.
6. Start the script using:

   ```console
   python3 well-known-adhoc.py
   ```

#### Details of the .well-known Analysis

Analyze the full crawl set with the redo sites replaced, i.e., using the full set of sites and the sites that we have redone (which replaced the original sites with redo sites).

- Output

  1. If successful, a csv with three columns will be created: Site URL, request status, json data.
  2. If not successful, an error json file will be created: logs all errors, including the reason for an error and 500 characters of the request text.

     Examples of an error:

     - "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)": the status code was 200 (site exists and loaded) or 202 (the request is accepted but incomplete processing) but did not find a json (output: Site_URL, 200, None or Site_URL, 202, None)
     - Reason: site sent all incorrect URLs to a generic error page instead of not serving the page, which would have been a 404 status code

- Status Codes (HTTP Responses)
  - In general, we expect a 404 status code (Not Found) when a site does not have a .well-known/gpc.json (output: Site_URL, 404, None)
  - Other possible status codes signaling that the .well-known data is not found include but are not limited to: 403 (Forbidden: the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it), 500 (Internal Server Error: the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request), 406 (Not Acceptable: the server cannot produce a response matching the list of acceptable values define), 429 (Too Many Requests)
